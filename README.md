# Coding-Highlights
Code I've written for potential employers to see


main-pipeline_formatted: This is a large pipeline for reading in, formatting/processing, and analyzing data that I used for my undergraduate thesis research in the Dwyer Lab at UChicago. It demonstrates my skills working with large data sets in R, using the tidyverse packages, and using ggplot.

linearization_lab_JacobFeingold: This is a lab assignment for a Mathematical Modeling in Python course I took at UChicago. It showcases my skills working with complicated linear algebra concepts in code as well as my Python skills.
